This experiment evaluates how newly exposed copper corrodes in different drinking-water chemistries 
using Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation (QCM-D). As corrosion occurs,frequency shifts (Δf) 
are converted to surface mass loss (Δm) using the Sauerbrey-based conversion provided in the dataset. 

Across all five drinking-water conditions, the QCM-D mass-loss curves clearly demonstrated how water
chemistry controls copper degradation. Since Δm directly reflects corrosion kinetics, the influence
of pH, chloride, and orthophosphate on copper passivation and dissolution can be compared across five
water conditions. 

By modelling Δm vs. time using predictive techniques such as Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and 
Weibull degradation fits, the study aims to identify corrosion trends, detect passive film breakdown, 
and forecast long-term behavior. These insights support improved corrosion control and material 
durability in drinking-water distribution system.

Low-pH water (Condition A) caused fast and continuous corrosion, while adding orthophosphate (C & D) 
and/or increasing pH (B & D) helped form a protective passive film, reducing metal loss significantly. 
Condition D (pH 9 + phosphate) showed the best protection, whereas Conditions B and E exhibited partial
film stability followed by breakdown, indicating vulnerability to localized corrosion over time.

In terms of prediction capability, the GAM model captured the true corrosion behavior most accurately —
including slow initiation, passivation plateaus, and sudden acceleration phases. The Weibull model 
performed well only in simpler, monotonic corrosion trends, but struggled when film-formation and
breakdown occurred. Therefore, GAM is the preferred model for realistic corrosion forecasting, 
especially when surface processes are complex and time-dependent.
